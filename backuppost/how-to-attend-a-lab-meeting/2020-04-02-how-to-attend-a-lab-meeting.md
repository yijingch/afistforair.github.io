"let's have a carb party"  
and you brought chips (no dipping sauce whatsoever)   
but the goal was:  
to be deprived, until  
there's nothing left underneath  
so you could comment on food, stand still, and greet people  
(resonation of all kinds)  
the eagle hovering by, the neighbor's dog eavesdropping  
it's getting cold,  
and peaceful.
