I was wondering  
how did people recognize a table  
before they ever sat at a table  
how did the first person who came up with the idea  
introduce a quasi-table to friends,  
\- here's the thing you can sit beside, and eat dinner  
\- what's even dinner?  
\- a time for contemplation, "to be alone with others"  
\- then what's a table for?  

for holding your plates, or anything you have to confront with,  
or hide behind, before your evenings
