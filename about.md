c sliced herself into pieces at the age of 17 and deposited them at a secret blimp, which, unfortunately, went bankrupt later. Her fragments exploded everywhere and were tossed around by strangers, friends, and herself in pure ecstasy. She uses this site as a temporary journal page as she carefully collects her pieces.

Lessons:  
- Do not slice yourself for fun;
- if you have to, do not deposit them at one place.

She can be reached via tripletabs at gmail dot com.
