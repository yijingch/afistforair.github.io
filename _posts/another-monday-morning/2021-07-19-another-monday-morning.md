Something else I thought about:    
 the horrible smell of pretexts;      
the crispy wall between     
 one’s aesthetic desire and their belittled love;     
that the harder one tried to deny it,     
the stronger it  would teethe back like a     
small     
brilliant     
monster      
unfolding its fingers;     
that the past is not adequate; that     
 historians work as they stare straight into the void
