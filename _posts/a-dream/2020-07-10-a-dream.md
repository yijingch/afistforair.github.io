The other day I dreamed about a friend. He told me that another Daniel Sloss’ special was available. I immediately knew this was a dream as the friend doesn’t care much about comedy, at least not as much as I do. But I lingered in that false reality, almost consciously forging the conversations that shouldn’t had happened.   At the end, the friend gave me an untamed, puzzled look. Then I woke up in sweat, and finally recognized myself as this unwelcome guest who carries extra speeches and extra tears, extra everything, floating around. The friend said nothing. I chewed on the residuals of his mind word by word.

“I also wish to be unapologetically me. One day I will be unapologetically here.”
