The cashier then slid the box of icecream bar   
toward us. An inexplicably smooth,  
silent slide.  
We returned home merrily and  
watched two episodes of the Golden Girls, but lines.  
Lines burst in out of design.  
“I know he’s dead.  
I just like to talk about him in the present tense.”  
Where were us? Still in these recurring evenings of outage?  
There. In complete darkness, they   
leaned against the wall and  
inched down an unknown route, canned   
in intermittent whispers like a dusking pond being lit up,
flaringly,    
by the moon, patches    
by patches--as in my dream,    
their eyes wide open, until     
there’s nothing else to be seen.
