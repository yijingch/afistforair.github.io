MACHINE sees you  
MACHINE reads your favorites, clockwise  
MACHINE never understands itself; it doesn't have to, as long as  
it answers your question, once you ask  
MACHINE never gets confused, but it can be interrupted by teeny-tiny errors  
(e.g., a stupid typo)    
MACHINE plays by rules, every single one of them  
MACHINE finds the shortest path,  
MACHINE strategically allocates its attention, to something, ignoring the rest  
MACHINE fails to recognize you, it's just biased  
MACHINE outsmarts itself by overfitting,  
MACHINE takes a shower every millisecond, like a new-born pony  
MACHINE forgets all as there's no need to remember  
MACHINE loves nothing,  
MACHINE serves everyone.
