Before dawn,  
Things were dripping,  
Shuffling,  
There they found the lost keys,  
Answers out-loud on the shelf,   
Punctual gestures, worn-out boots.  
One was torn by this unspoken message:  
“Love is mercy.”  
Then at thunderstormed weekends,  
They would fill the room with mountainous tenderness,  
From the floor to the ceiling.  
Shoulders hunched.  
Nature, too, bears the pain within.
