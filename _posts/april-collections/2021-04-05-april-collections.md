**Defining features (2021.4.12)**

I was wondering  
how did people recognize a table  
before they ever sat at a table  
how did the first person who came up with the idea  
introduce a quasi-table to friends,  
\- here's the thing you can sit beside, and eat dinner  
\- what's even dinner?  
\- a time for contemplation, "to be alone with others"  
\- then what's a table for?  

for holding your plates, or anything you have to confront with,  
or hide behind, before your evenings  


**Routine review (2021.4.10)**

to recover from the shock  
as an infant,   
or as a dying elephant, striding slowly with a clear conscious mind  
toward the cemetery of secrets;   
of innocent short stories,  
that we tentatively agree, for now,  
will not break the patio,  
will do no harm.   


**Daydream (2021.4.5)**

may our words become the clouds  
of our statues  
each with an identical face, pronounced eyebrows   
that barely smiled, the very opposite of  
rejoicing, after all,  
is the relief  
from a morning burial.  
and I never hear back from you since.  
here comes the new summer.  


**How to attend a lab meeting (2021.4.2)**

"let's have a carb party"  
and you brought chips (no dipping sauce whatsoever)   
but the goal was:  
to be deprived, until  
there's nothing left underneath  
so you could comment on food, stand still, and greet people  
(resonation of all kinds)  
the eagle hovering by, the neighbor's dog eavesdropping  
it's getting cold,  
and peaceful.
