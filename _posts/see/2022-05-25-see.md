Heading outward, I was made aware of my misprinted ideals, that I  
obliviated too eagerly, being liberated from debrisÂ but not the sun, and that   
a formulation was not a discovery.   
"Yet a formulation should suffice", my argument voyaged    
into spirals lined in white   
chalked numbers, rearranged.  
While I was wearing these wrong boots,     
squishing, squashing,    
in a public exhibition of horrors, my horror speaks--   
why would I regress from them, if I, too,    
were straight visceral, raw and harmless,    
an irreducible mass of stillness, born singing?
