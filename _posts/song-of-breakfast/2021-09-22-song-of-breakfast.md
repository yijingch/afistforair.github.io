去新城市购买冷冻面点的节拍基于POS机的鸣音。收银员不望向你  
而你望向过去，在  
次日微波炉鸣叫时，终止：早餐。  
一种谬误学习  

例一：离去后不要敲门。爱人是  
一个跳章   
拖曳另一个跳章拖曳另一个，不计其数的镂空    
回形针  

例二：犹豫是美德。但美德  
（你要知道它只不过依靠一种艰巨，依靠永续的疑问）   
仅仅提供排除法：  
不要欺骗，不要傲慢，不要逾越   
为此你偷偷在马路穿行  

例三：选择更迟到的回答——除非它愚蠢  
即便它新颖。感恩节应该准许人们互相憎恨，吼叫  
“不必谢”   
直到送别完成

**Song of breakfast**


At a new city the purchase of a frozen pastry rhymes with the beep of POS machine; the cashier does not look toward you, and  
you look toward the past. When  
the microwave dings the next day, terminate: breakfast.  
A study of fallacy.  

Exhibit A: Do not knock after leaving. Loving one is  
a jumping chapter  
wrenching another jumping chapter wrenching another, countless paperclips in skeletons.  

Exhibit B: Hesitation is a virtue. But virtues   
(I need you to know that it only relies on some forms of difficulty, on questions that will never rest)  
provide a method of elimination, merely:  
do not cheat, do not arrogate, do not exceed,  
for which you cross the road in secret.  
Exhibit C: Choose the later answer—if not mindless.  
If new. Thanksgiving should allow people to loathe each other, yelling “Forget it!”  
till the farewell is concluded.
