And people would casually say that you sound American. You don't know how to respond. The accent is right there no matter what you come up with for the footnote. FYI I was there for two years. FYI I watched too much of their comedies during covid. FYI I'm working on US data a lot for research. FYI I like talking to my American friends. FYI my Mandarin is perfect as well. Laying beneath those reflexes are the stings of not knowing what's assumed, and people would let you tiptoe around, take time to decide whether this is a big deal worth making a speech about, and grind through the rest of the conversations. These evenings are long, quiet and indifferent.
