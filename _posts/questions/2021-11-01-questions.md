Dear friend,

I disagree that sorrow literarizes us. On the contrary, sorrow consumes us, the same way we consume sorrow, sometimes of our own but regrettably, more of others.

Then I came to understand even better the meaning of loss—loss means “inability”, no longer being able to function in a certain way, apart from which there’s nothing greater, more granular. I suppose a smarter, or a more (inappropriate?) literary approach is to take your loss as a sign, leaning against it while you read, write, and talk. People can (and rarely do they fail to) work on this; in such a way they get to know each other. But I choose not to. I choose to be the deprived. I choose a godless and coreless world but may it maintain a godless and coreless self?
