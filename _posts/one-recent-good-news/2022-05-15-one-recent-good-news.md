One recent good news is that I started writing letters to several friends! The way our lives already are, distracted, permeable and precarious enough, usually occupies the front-stage of our communication (coded through layers of norms and expectations) that might flush out the arduously cultivated recognition of why we talk, hold hands or share a sprint of ecstasy in the first place. Hence there come the camouflaging danger of absence, the gradual languor of always being elsewhere, and the numbing fatigue that we shield ourselves from being truly aware, all of which I used to take as deplorable signs of a disjointed present never allowing me to participate. I somehow regained part of my presence through writing plain (sometimes abrupt) letters, which forced me to gauge precisely how much I care and dare to be inquisitive about the addressee. Indeed very much and very urgently was I actually in need of such precision. And Iâ€™m happy about it.
