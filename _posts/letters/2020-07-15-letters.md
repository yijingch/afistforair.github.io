my dearest friend,

that all lives are short, and that we are insignificantly in love with someone at some point, marked the interval between our blessings and struggles.

my dearest friend,

see, it's effortless for us to mimic an established language and to reproduce existing sets of vocabs, tones, grammars, etc; the tricky part is to detach from these things and to speak subversively; to create new contexts by breaking free from the rules of other narratives, even great, fascinating ones; to rebel against your presumable core and to keep writing until you have nothing else to confess or to defend; to remind me of your insignificant beings; or to live, if necessary; poems are disposable; what are us; and what makes our minds; words; feces; are our lives nothing but a sneezing impulse that takes too long to hold our breaths; regardless, be fierce and generous; I've been waiting.

my dearest friend,

I disagree that sorrow literalizes us. On the contrary, sorrow consumes us, the same way we consume sorrow, sometimes of our own but regrettably, more of others. Sorrow arrests the free-willed in disguise of offering redemption, and it is for this reason that I stopped admiring things or remembering her, that I don’t think I’m kind or evil enough, nor will I ever be. Indifference, for better or worse, is all I’m left with.
