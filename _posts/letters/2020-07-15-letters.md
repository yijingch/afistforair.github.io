my dearest friend,

that all lives are short, and that we are insignificantly in love with someone at some point, marked the interval between our blessings and struggles.

my dearest friend,

see, it's effortless for us to mimic an established language and to reproduce existing sets of vocabs, tones, grammars, etc; the tricky part is to detach from these things and to speak subversively; to create new contexts by breaking free from the rules of other narratives, even great, fascinating ones; to rebel against your presumable core and to keep writing until you have nothing else to confess or to defend; to remind me of your insignificant beings; or to live, if necessary; poems are disposable; what are us; and what makes our minds; words; feces; are our lives nothing but a sneezing impulse that takes too long to hold our breaths; regardless, be fierce and generous; I've been waiting.

my dearest friend,

I disagree that sorrow literarizes us. On the contrary, sorrow consumes us, the same way we consume sorrow, sometimes of our own but regrettably, more of others. Sorrow arrests the free-willed in disguise of offering a redemption, and it is for this reason that I stopped admiring things or remembering her, that I don’t think I’m kind or evil enough, nor will I ever be. Indifference, for better or worse, is all I’m left with.

my dearest friend,

Recently I think I better understood the meaning of loss. A very personal and immature understanding—loss means “inability”. It’s like one day you’re told that a certain type of accessory is no longer in supply. You know this means that you can no longer function in a certain way, "not being able to", apart from which there’s nothing greater, more granular. I suppose a smarter, or a more (is this inappropriate?) literary approach is to take your loss as a sign, relying on it while you read, write, watch films, take a stand, etc. People can (and rarely do they fail to) work on this as they become creators of all sorts, such is how they get to know each other. But I choose not to. I choose to be the deprived (endlessly and infinitely). I choose a godless and coreless world but may it maintain a godless and coreless self? What I’ve lost: names, friends, the ability to love/attack, words, memories, bodies, self-knowledge, eyesight, the fantasy of home—they draw me toward the edge of a cliff, a foothold that I'm standing on, where I live with the minimum amount of belongings.
