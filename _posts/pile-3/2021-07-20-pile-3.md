Things they cannot get rid of:  
the smell of subtexts;  
the crispy wall between oneâ€™s aesthetic desire and  
their belittled love;  
(where does arrogance stem from?)  
that the harder one tries to deny it, the stronger  
it will teethe back like a  
small  
brilliant  
monster  
unfolding its fingers;  
that the past alone is not adequate; that  
historians work as they stare straight into the void  

--as they gradually approach a point in time when  
those departed are no longer in sight.
