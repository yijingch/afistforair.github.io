we were back from groceries and the bag was huge  
it was an Ikea tote I recycled three years ago when the apartment   
contained me and a wooden tv stand painted in black  
I donâ€™t need a tv, I thought, but I want a library and a vintage Persian carpet  
a vast one, that silences the vacuum and evens out the cracking floor  

we were back from a trip in DC and the house was at rest   
the floor was cracking as we tiptoed upstairs with your suitcase   
where your nice sweater was folded   
delicately  
the delicacy of us  
we were blissfully unaware of  
was also folded within  
now the past has been spelled out   
as I remember you in this sweater from before, freshly shaved  
then the night train would come in three minutes   

we were back from our past  
ages before we knew each other or learned to get prepared   
for once again we would walk back  
diminishing as our spines untangle the memory  
until we become the noises ourselves.  
I would always walk in cold with you, I think,   
and mark the winter days as ceremonies.  
I have nothing to add you would conclude in a perfect tone.
