*When I lose touch with someone, the last thing to let go is their language—how they would write about a day, verbalize a Wednesday walk, how they would choose precisely their ways to punctuate and exclaim—through my knowledge of one’s language I feel befriended and beloved.*

*Scarlett and I started an email thread in late 2020, and since then we’ve been emailing each other whenever possible. We document this spontaneous selection of email excerpts to celebrate the great time we’ve had reading and writing letters, which began with my disturbingly intrusive question: do you really not mind me bringing up suicide every time I come talking to you?*

*We decide to make these excerpts semi-public to people we care about, in a context of our own that is no longer trivial. We believe it’s still crucial to write and to exchange, and we hope to inspire a few with our fragmented rants and yawns and dedicated non-conformity.*
