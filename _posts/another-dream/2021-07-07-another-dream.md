Mom just went into shock in front of me, before which I was urging her out. I need to be alone I said. She rubbed against the wall, slowly made her way to the door,  slowly leaned backward, and slowly collapsed on the floor. It was the first time I had watched someone collapse. I stepped over her and knocked on the door of dadâ€™s room. Mom just went into shock and is lying in my room. He was a little confused. Huh?   

Immediately got out of bed.   
Came over and tapped her shoulder.    
Called out her name.    
Mom woke up.   
Why was I lying here?    

Then with a painful expression, she recalled what had happened. Dad walked her back to their room.
