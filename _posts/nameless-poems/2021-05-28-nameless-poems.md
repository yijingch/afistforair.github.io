**\* (2021.5.28)**  
it's never impossible to come up with     
plenty of reasons to forgive    
but not to forget how it answers to a faint,   
a uniquely beautiful, immensely   
beautiful   
prologue,   
for instance,   
the moment of realization!   
that there has not (yet) been a gleam of truce or,   
with your own choice of phrases absent (as always)   
observing,   
settling into laughters, compromises, remorses  
isnâ€™t it, exactly, our shared context?   
"Dim the light, please."  
"No worries. It will end properly."  

(and there's no such thing as a shared context)

**\* (2021.5.11)**  
when will a mute talk   
about her cave prints   
and toothbrushes,  
while she awaits the answer, patiently,  
she's no longer in despair,   
for there's none  
no one, not a single baggage to collect   
pick a nameless song and   
suit yourself
