- Sometimes I could see you secretly sketching people during the conversations...
- ...like reserving part of yourself aside to detach and criticize--one’s brilliance is almost as bleak as one’s bravery; seem to be short of proper sidelines; self-righteous in one’s own miraculous way--quick, resolute conclusions as such (looked away)

Everything--shrapnels, pencil shavings, syllables and punctuations that we thought were unbreakable--is being shattered into smaller, more insignificant particles that would allow us to indulge in.
