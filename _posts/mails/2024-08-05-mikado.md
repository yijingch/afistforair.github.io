(for Niel)

finally emptied my mailbox last Friday  
promotion ads, newspapers, two amazon packages and unknown mails to previous tenants  
Niel said I was supposed to mail them back with a note   
that they don’t live here anymore   
in my mind I was also not here anymore   
but to be flashing present   
on the day before the picnic in Schönbrunn when love was decided to be outspoken  
love was therefore observed   
in stop motion  
snapshots of fleeting objects   
visualizing a movement  
a pose of wonder   
that now rents my apartment  
while we walk around in bare feet  
and blink very slowly
