fell on my tailbone from the stairs to the kitchen,  
for weeks I walked around with a stiff pain   
that spoke to me every time I tried to sit:  
prudence  
to be mastered with care, or  
the Roselle of hidden choices; do you  
really (not)   
remember?   
but again I do not want to think about death,  
about why I had to scan the raw story of a stranger,   
about what to learn from a morning fall, where it took me to.   
I was being careless, and perhaps   
I prompted the wrong question.  
but the question was saving me from cascades of wrong answers, which taught me   
patience,   
to be mastered with care, or   
the Roselle of hidden choices. I now,  
understand my oblivion.
