**\* (2021.6.8)**

After I left the courtroom, I thought about those unfinished stories a lot. Reheated plates; long walks that she didn't get a chance to take; those mornings as well. I thought about the empty living room as if I were absent. As if we had been slowly erased one by one (what a relief!) without any knowledge of where and how this should possibly end. Only the audience can mercifully comment—a voice that cannot be unheard—sure, if this is not the closing scene, I can't think of any.


**\* (2021.5.28)**  
it's never impossible to come up with     
plenty of reasons to forgive    
but not to forget how it answers to a faint,   
a uniquely beautiful, immensely   
beautiful   
prologue,   
for instance,   
the moment of realization!   
that there has not (yet) been a gleam of truce or,   
with your own choice of phrases absent (as always)   
observing,   
settling into laughters, compromises, remorses  
isn’t it, exactly, our shared context?   
"Dim the light, please."  
"No worries. It will end properly."  

(and there's no such thing as a shared context)  


**\* (2021.5.11)**  
when will a mute talk   
about her cave prints   
and toothbrushes,  
while she awaits the answer, patiently,  
she's no longer in despair,   
for there's none  
no one, not a single baggage to collect   
pick a nameless song and   
suit yourself  


**\* (2020.12.14)**    
dried eyes and fading footsteps in March   
"that's pretty easy," one said,   
"follow the person who leads the way," the other replied   
in a voice I shall never recognize.     
I stared at your couch, the headlight   
of passing vehicles   
"who would have thought of suicide?"   
"why the hell did my shoelaces come untied, again?"  


**\* (2020.10.19)**  
我什么也没有失去的  
一个秋天下午  
河边的小孩  
踩着碎石  
请您，听完这一首后  
砸烂我的手指  
人类，也是秃鹫  
也继承死亡
