**Daydream (2021.4.5)**

may our words become the clouds  
of our statues  
each with an identical face, pronounced eyebrows   
that barely smiled, the very opposite of  
rejoicing, after all,  
is the relief  
from a morning burial.  
and I never hear back from you since.  
here comes the new summer.  

**Note to self (2021.3.18)**

please do  
cut it to essentials, mattress, coffee, bathroom,   
and signals of,  
if better, mutual allegiance,  
that our memories of growing whales   
will never exhaust,  
nor will we part without a closure.
